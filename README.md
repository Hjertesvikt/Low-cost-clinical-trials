# Low-cost-clinical-trials
There is something weird with clinical trials on neurodegenerative diseases, they seems to always fail.
For example there were ~50 completed interventional phase III ALS clinical trials and ~170 completed interventional  phase III Alzheimer clinical trials. On overall there were nearly 2500 interventional clinical trials on Alzheimer disease. For diabetes it is even worth: ~ 1500 completed interventional phase Studies

There are some aspects that are important to understand those failures:
- Chronic diseases, and specially neurodegenerative diseases will certainly not show obvious improvement during the 6 months duration of good clinical studies. Such clinical trials must last years.
- Industry and investors will never try non patentable drugs. Example of such drugs are repurposed drugs with expired patents, drugs which were described in prior art, or natural products such as TUDCA. Or they associate another drug to the natural product to make the combo patentable.
- The industry does not think much of academic research. Oftentimes academic proposals are ignored because of risk or prior art. predict 
- Actors of clinical trials are sometime not very reliable. The recruitement of patients may have flaws, medical examinations may be sloppy, and anyway patients take supplements when they think they are in the control group.
- Most drugs used in neurodegenerative diseases have strong side effects such as they can't be seriously considered for long term use.

There is a need for lost cost clinical trials using non patentable drugs. For example it is obvious many diabetes drugs could be tried in ALS or other diseases. Indeed University of Florida studies Metformin in NCT04220021.
Tools to repurpose non patentable drugs are needed.
* Clinical trials should rely on general practitioners, not on specialists, as it's these medical professional who will interact with patients on a day to day basis.
* Clinical trials should use Haley platform like methodologies to make sure that no patient is left only with placebo.
* Hosted software should manage the double blinded procurement of drugs.
