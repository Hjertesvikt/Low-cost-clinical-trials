# Low-cost-clinical-trials
There is something weird with clinical trials on neurodegenerative diseases, they seem to always fail.
For example there were ~50 completed interventional phase III ALS clinical trials and ~170 completed interventional  phase III Alzheimer clinical trials. On overall there were nearly 2500 interventional clinical trials on Alzheimer disease. For diabetes it is even worth: ~ 1500 completed interventional phase Studies

To understand those failures, there are some aspects that are important to realize:
- Chronic diseases, and specially neurodegenerative diseases will certainly not show obvious improvement during the 6 months duration of good clinical studies. Such clinical trials must last years, and indeed short term clininal trial could only fail.
- Industry and investors will never try non patentable drugs. Yet there are many non patentable drugs that will never be tested by the industry. For example it is obvious that many diabetes drugs could be tried in ALS or other neurodegenerative diseases. One of the too rare cases is University of Florida studying Metformin in NCT04220021.
- Tools are needed to find non patentable drugs that could potentially be repurposed. Example of such drugs are repurposed drugs with expired patents, drugs which were described in academic prior art, or natural products such as TUDCA.
- The industry look down on academic research. Often, academic proposals are ignored due to risk of prior art.
- Actors of clinical trials are sometime not very reliable. The recruitement of patients may have flaws, medical examinations may be sloppy, and anyway patients take supplements when they think they are in the control group.
- Most drugs used in neurodegenerative diseases have strong side effects such as they can't be seriously considered for long term use. This lead to reluctance to prescribe by primary care physicians.
- Clinical trials should rely on the medical professionals who will interact with patients on a day to day basis.
- Clinical trials should use Haley platform like methodologies to make sure that no patient is left only with placebo.
- Hosted software should manage the double blinded procurement of drugs.

We will propose here a tailored low cost Clinical Data Management System that fits those requirements.
